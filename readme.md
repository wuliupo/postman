Supercharge your API workflow with Postman! 

Build, test, and document your APIs faster. More than a million developers already do.…

The idea for Postman arose while the founders were working together, and were frustrated with the existing tools for testing APIs. They felt there had to be a better language for developers to communicate about APIs. This led to the creation of Postman. Postman helps you build, test, and document APIs faster. 

Postman features include:

- History of sent requests
- Create requests quickly
- Replay and organize
- Switch context quickly
- Built-in authentication helpers
- Customize with scripts
- Robust testing framework
- Automate collections

Apart from this, you can also upgrade with Jetpacks to unlock the collection runner and test editor within Postman. Only $9.99 for a single license. Free upgrades for life.

All this is available in an intuitive user interface that would make testing APIs effortless.

Note on Permissions

The “Your data on all websites” permission is required to send a request to a domain. It's not used for anything else. It's not a new permission and Postman has required it since it was launched.
